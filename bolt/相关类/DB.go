	// Setting the NoSync flag will cause the database to skip fsync()
	// calls after each commit. This can be useful when bulk loading data
	// into a database and you can restart the bulk load in the event of
	// a system failure or database corruption. Do not set this flag for

	// If the package global IgnoreNoSync constant is true, this value is

	// Setting this to true is only safe on non-ext3/ext4 systems.
