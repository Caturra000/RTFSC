/*
   have_fastchunks indicates that there are probably some fastbin chunks.
   It is set true on entering a chunk into any fastbin, and cleared early in
   malloc_consolidate.  The value is approximate since it may be set when there
   are no fastbin chunks, or it may be clear even if there are fastbin chunks
   available.  Given it's sole purpose is to reduce number of redundant calls to
   malloc_consolidate, it does not affect correctness.  As a result we can safely
   use relaxed atomic accesses.
