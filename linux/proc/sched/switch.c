 * be slow is a fairly red herring - this code is not noticeably
 * faster. However, there _is_ some room for improvement here,
 * so the performance issues may eventually be a valid point.
 * More important, however, is the fact that this allows us much
 * more flexibility.
 *
 * The return value (in %ax) will be the "prev" task after
 * the task-switch, and shows up in ret_from_fork in entry.S,
