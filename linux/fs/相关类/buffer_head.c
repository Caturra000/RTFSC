// /include/linux/buffer_head.h

/*
 * Historically, a buffer_head was used to map a single block
 * within a page, and of course as the unit of I/O through the
 * filesystem and block layers.  Nowadays the basic I/O unit
 * is the bio, and buffer_heads are used for extracting block
 * mappings (via a get_block_t call), for tracking state within
 * a page (via a page_mapping) and for wrapping bio submission
 * for backward compatibility reasons (e.g. submit_bh).
